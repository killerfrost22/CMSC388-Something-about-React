	<h1>Partnerships</h1>

	<p>
		Another sign of community-building is the growth of
		UM-partnerships. The investment of pivate resources in the UM
		mission suggests that shared goals -education, innovation, and
		entrepreneurship--create productive alliances. Such public/private
		partnerships are helping to make UM education affordable and
		accessible to all students. Chevy Chase Bank has joined with UM in
		a partnership that will benefit scholarships and better athletics
		facilities. Dell and Apple computers have joined forces with the
		Office of Information Technology to provide affordable computers
		for students, faculty and staff.

		Progress on the new M Square Research Park, 128 acres at the
		College Park Metro station, is another example of such
		partnerships. Collaboration between the University, the State, the
		federal government and private sector businesses promise to build
		UM's research programs in depth and breadth. Several steps occurred
		this year that advanced the University closer to the complete
		vision of M Square as a hub for collaborative research initiatives:
		the National Foreign Language Center moved into the Patapsco
		Building at M Square and Datastream graduated from the Technology
		Advancement Program on campus to the Technology Ventures building
		at M Square. Physically, the site is now primed with 65 acres
		readied for new building construction. Construction of the first
		120,000 square foot spec building is set to begin this October, and
		the main road, University Research Court, is now completed. The
		residential component of M Square, which will provide upscale
		condominiums to researchers and the general public, has received
		its state approvals. An exciting feature of this condominium
		project is that the university will own 50 units, which will be
		allocated on a competitive basis to attract the "best and the
		brightest" graduate and postdoctoral students and visitors from
		around the world.
