	</p>

	<!-- careful with the identation of pre -->
	<pre class="styleOne">
        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood
        And sorry I could not travel both
        And be one traveler, long I stood
        And looked down one as far as I could
        To where it bent in the undergrowth
	</pre>

	<pre class="styleTwo styleThree">
        Then took the other as just as fair
        And having perhaps the better claim
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
        Though as for that, the passing there
        Had worn them really about the same
	</pre>

	<pre class="styleOne">
        And both that morning equally lay
        In leaves no step had trodden black
        Oh, I kept the first for another day!
        Yet knowing how way leads onto way
        I doubted if I should ever come back
	</pre>

	<pre class="styleTwo">
        I shall be telling this with a sigh
        Somewhere ages and ages hence
        Two roads diverged in a wood
        And I took the one less traveled by
        And that has made all the difference
	</pre>
