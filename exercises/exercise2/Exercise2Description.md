# Exercise 2:

## Due Date: Saturday January 16, 11:59 PM 

## Objectives: To get familiar with javascript functional prototypes, template strings, arrays and higher order javascript array functions.

## Specifications/Requirements

1. Description:
   To complete this exercise you will be working in `exercise2.html` where you will be using the javascript functional prototype provided in the comments in order to obtain the required data and display it in the console using template strings to format output.

2. Formating and output:
   You will be logging all your results to the console, and the specification as to how the ouput should look are included in the comments above each exercise. If there are no specifications for an exercises output you may assume that there is no special formating associated with that exercise (refer to the recordings for how it should appear). 

3. Fix the getPresidentInfo() function:  
   The `getPresidentInfo()` function will create a new div in the dom every time the user clicks the `Get President Name` button. There is an error in the code. It creates a new div to store the name of the president with the same value for the id attribute. You need to update this function so it creates a unique id for every call of this event listener.

4. Additional Notes:
   You should not alter the presidents data we provide you with. This should go without saying, but you should not hardcode your results, we will check your submissions to make sure this does not happen. You should use the functional array prototypes that we have gone over in class and that are mentioned in this exercise (map, sort, filter, reduce), using for loops, for..of loops, while loops, etc will result in a substantial amount of point deduction.
